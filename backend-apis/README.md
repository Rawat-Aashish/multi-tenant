## 🔒 Security & Multi-Tenancy

This API implements robust multi-tenant architecture with the following security measures:

- **Role-based access control** (Shop Owner vs Customer permissions) implemented using a custom middleware named `RoleAccessControlMiddleware`
- **Data isolation** ensuring shops can only access and perform actions on their own resources, enforced through Laravel policies
- **Authentication required** for all endpoints except login, implemented with Laravel Sanctum
- **Tenant-specific filtering** on all data queries

## 🧪 Testing

### Postman Collection
Use the provided Postman collection to test all endpoints with pre-configured requests and proper authentication headers. Each endpoint includes example payloads and expected responses.

### Automated Tests
The project includes comprehensive automated tests for code quality assurance. You can review the following test files:

- `ProductApiTest.php` - API endpoint testing
- `ProductServiceTest.php` - Service layer testing

**Run tests with:**
```bash
php artisan test
```
